# KeebDeck Keyboard Hardware Files

![](./img/front.jpg)

**EasyEDA, and Altium footprints coming really soon!**

The KeebDeck Keyboard is a compact (85x48mm) 69-key alphanumeric silicone keypad with an orthogonal layout based on standard PC keyboards. The keyboard utilizes a sandwich-style design, requiring a footprint to be placed on a PCB so that the adhesive dome sheet can be applied on top of it. The silicone keypad then goes on top of the dome sheet and requires a top case (another PCB, a 3D-printed/milled/etc. cover) that will keep the keypad in place.

Full documentation [available here](https://docs.solder.party/keebdeck/keyboard).

3D models for the keypad and dome sheet can be found in the `KiCad/KeebDeck_Keyboard.3dshapes` folder.

The `Eagle/` folder also contains a library for Fusion.

You can purchase the Keyboard as well as other KeebDeck boards from our Lectronz store: https://lectronz.com/stores/solderparty/

## Note

Only the 6x13 KeebDeck Keyboard files are final. The 3D models and footprints for all other sizes should be considered work in progress.
